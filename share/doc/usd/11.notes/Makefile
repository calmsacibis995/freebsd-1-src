#	Note that the macros are set up for two-sided copying.
#	The page numbers alternate between the left and right 
#	sides of the page.
#	See the file "macros" and the macro "hh" to modify this
#
#	This copy of everything has been modified to run with troff
#	and a typesetter. Hopefully the only changes to make it
#	run again under nroff will be in page length/width statements.

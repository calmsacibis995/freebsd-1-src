.Nd bus mouse driver
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a simple driver for the Logitech and ATI Inport bus mouse interfaces
designed to be used with the X386 X11R5 X server. The minor device number is
made up of:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
minor = ('unit' << 1) | 'non-blocking'
.Ed
.Pp
where 'unit' is the device number (usually 0) and the 'non-blocking' bit
is set to indicate "don't block waiting for mouse input, return 0 instead".
The 'non-blocking' bit should be set for X386, therefore the minor device
number usually used for X386 is 1.
.Sh Caveats
Most bus mice generate N interrupts/second when enabled, whether or not the
mouse state is changing.

Parallel port driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "device lpt0 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT1\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Cd "device lpt1 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT2\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Cd "device lpt2 at isa? port" \&"IO_LPT3\&" tty irq 7 vector lptintr
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to parallel ports.  It assumes that
the parallel port controller interrupts the CPU properly.  If
this is not the case, the
.Nm lpa
driver should be used instead.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width Pa -compact

.Sh SEE ALSO

.Sh BUGS
There are lots of them, especially in cheap parallel port implementations.
.Pp
This driver could stand a rewrite.

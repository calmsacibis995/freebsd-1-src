.Sh DESCRIPTION

Access to the
.Ar virtual consoles 
are obtained through the device files
tty01 - ttynn in /dev. 
Each of these files correspond to a seperate
virtual console.
All virtual console devices can be open at once, but only one is 
active at a time. The active virtual console "owns" the keyboard and
display screen.
.Pp
Output to a virtual console that not currently is on the display is
saved in a buffer that holds a "screenfull" (normally 25) lines.
Any output written to 
.Ar /dev/console 
(the original console device) is echoed to /dev/tty01.
.Pp
To switch between the virtual consoles one uses the sequence 
.Ar ALT+Fn
, which means hold down ALT and press one of the function keys. The 
virtual console with the same number as the function key is then
selected as the current virtual console, and given exclusive use of
the keyboard and display. This switch sequence can be changed via
the keyboard mapping ioctl call (see keyboard.man)
.Pp
The number of virtual consoles is changeable in the system config 
file, and need recompilation of the kernel to take any effect. The
default is 12.

The console allows entering values that are not physically
present on the keyboard via a special keysequence.
To use this facility press and hold down ALT,
then enter a decimal number from 0-255 via the numerical keypad, then
release ALT. The entered value is then used as the ASCII value for one
character. This way it is possible to enter any ASCII value.

The console understands a subset of the ANSI x3.64 character 
sequences. For compatibility with the old pccons, the PC3 character
sequences is also supported.

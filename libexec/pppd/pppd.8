.SH NAME
pppd \- Point to Point Protocol daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pppd
[
.I option
]
.B tty_name speed
[
.I local_IP_address

.I remote_IP_address
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) provides a method for transmitting
datagrams over serial point-to-point links. 
.I pppd
is composed of three parts:
.TP
1. A method for encapsulating datagrams over serial links.
.TP
2. An extensible Link Control Protocol (LCP).
.TP
3. A family of Network Control Protocols (NCP) for establishing
and configuring different network-layer protocols.
.LP
.I pppd
currently supports the encapsulation scheme, the basic LCP, and an
NCP for establishing and configuring the Internet Protocol (IP)
(called the IP Control Protocol, IPCP).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -all
Don't request/allow any options
.TP
.B -ac
Disable Address/Control compression negotiation
.TP
.B -am
Disable asyncmap negotiation
.TP
.B -as <n>
Set the desired async map to hex <n>.  The default async map is 0xffffffff.
.TP
.B -d
Increase debugging level
.TP
.B -detach
Don't fork to become a background process
.TP
.B -ip
Disable IP address negotiation
.TP
.B -mn
Disable magic number negotiation
.TP
.B -mru
Disable MRU [Maximum Receive Unit] negotiation
.TP
.B -p
Set passive mode
.TP
.B -pc
Disable protocol field compression negotiation
.TP
.B +ua <p>
Require UPAP [User/Password Authentication Protocol] authentication.
Use the data in file <p> for the user and password to send to the
peer. The file contains the remote user name, followed by a newline,
followed by the remote password.
.TP
.B -ua
Don't allow UPAP authentication
.TP
.B +chap
Require CHAP [Cryptographic Handshake Authentication Protocol] authentication.
Use the data in file /usr/local/etc/ppp/chap, which contains
host name/secret pairs separated by newlines, to authenticate the peer.
In the data file, a host name of "default" will match any host name
not already specified in the file.
.TP
.B -chap
Don't allow CHAP authentication
.TP
.B asyncmap <map>
Set the async character map to <map>.
This map describes which control characters to "escape" in the serial data
stream.
The argument is a 32 bit hex number represented as 8 hex characters,
with each bit representing a character to escape.  
The lowest bit (i.e. 00000001) represents the character 0x00
The highest bit (i.e. 80000000) represents the character 0x1f or ^_.  
.TP
.B connect <p>
Use the executable or shell command specified by <p> to set-up the
serial line.  This script would typically use the "chat" program to
dial the modem and start the remote ppp session.
.TP
.B crtscts
Use hardware flow control (i.e. RTS/CTS) to control the flow of data on
the serial port.
.TP
.B debug
Increase debugging level
.TP
.B domain <d>
Append the domain name <d> to the local host name for authentication
purposes.  I.e., if gethostname() returns the name porsche, but the
fully qualified domain name is porsche.Quotron.COM, you would use the
domain option to set the domain name to Quotron.COM.
.TP
.B mru <n>
Set MRU value to <n> for negotiation.  The minimum MRU value is 128.
The default MRU value is 1500.
.TP
.B netmask <n>
Set the interface netmask to <n>, a 32 bit netmask in "decimal dot notation"
(i.e. 255.255.255.0).
.TP
.B passive
Set passive mode; Don't send LCP configure requests. Sets initial state to
"listen".
.TP
.B vjmode <m>
Specifies which version of IPCP Van Jacobson Compression negotiation
to use. Specify
.I old
for <m> to have backward compatibility with early versions of
.I pppd
which operated "incorrectly" when negotiating Compression-Type due to a
typographical error in the RFC.
.I pppd
(4.1, patch level 4 and later)
have this problem corrected but to allow interoperability with older versions
you can force this "incorrect" behavior.  Specify
.I rfc1172
for <m> to use the RFC1172 value for negotiation.  To use the
new version of negotiation specified in RFC1132 for
IPCP (the default), specify
.I rfc1132
for <m>.
.TP
.B -vj
This disables the use of Van Jacobson style IP header compression
altogether.  
.TP
.B <tty_name>
Communicate over the named device
.TP
.B <speed>
Set the baud rate to <speed>
.TP
.B <local_IP_address>:<remote_IP_address>
Set the local and/or remote interface IP addresses.  Either one may be omitted.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.LP
There is, currently, only one level of debugging available.  Debugging is
enabled by setting the -d or debug flag on the command line.  Debugging may
also be enabled after
.I pppd
is running by sending a SIGUSR1 to the
.I pppd
process.
Debugging may be disabled by sending a SIGUSR2 to the
.I pppd
process.
.LP
Error and warning messages are sent to the syslog daemon using facility
LOG_DAEMON unless
.I pppd
has been compiled with debugging code.  In this case the logging
facility used will be LOG_LOCAL2 in order to allow separation of the debug
output from the other daemons using the  LOG_DAEMON facility.  You can
override this by defining the macro LOG_PPP to the desired facility
and recompiling.  In order to see the error and debug messages, you
will need to edit your /etc/syslog.conf file to direct the messages to
the desired output device or file.
.LP
Debugging is currently available for 
.I fsm.c
\- the {Link, IP} Control Protocol Finite State Machine module;
.I lcp.c
\- the PPP Link Control Protocol module;
.I ipcp.c
\- the PPP IP Control Protocol module;
.I upap.c
\- the User/Password Authentication Protocol module;
and
.I chap.c
\- the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol module.
.SH NOTES
The following signals have the specified effect when sent to the
.I pppd
process.
.TP
.B SIGINT
This signal is normally generated by a Ctrl-C or DEL.
Causes
.I pppd
to initiate a graceful disconnect and exit.
.I pppd
will adjust the timeouts and close the connection.
.TP
.B SIGTERM
Causes 
.I pppd
to initiate a graceful disconnect and exit.
.I pppd
will adjust the timeouts and close the connection.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
Indicates that the physical layer has been disconnected.  You will
probably see "Bad file number" errors in the log output due to the way
the STREAMS-based tty driver handles a hangup.  You can ignore
these errors in this case.
.I pppd
will adjust the timeouts and reset the connection.
.SH BUGS
Note that sections the current implementation of
.I pppd
 are based on older RFCs and draft RFCs and may not be fully
compatible with the latest draft RFC versions.

.Sh NAME
.Nm st
.Nd magnetic tape manipulating program
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm st
.Op Fl f Ar tapename
.Ar command
.Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm St
is used to give commands to a magnetic tape drive.
By default
.Nm st
performs the requested operation once.  Operations
may be performed multiple times by specifying
.Ar count  .
Note
that
.Ar tapename
must reference a raw (not block) tape device.
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.  Only as many
characters as are required to uniquely identify a command
need be specified.
.Bl -tag -width "eof, weof"
.It Cm eof , weof
Write
.Ar count
end-of-file marks at the current position on the tape.
.It Cm fsf
Forward space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm fsr
Forward space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm bsf
Back space
.Ar count
files.
.It Cm bsr
Back space
.Ar count
records.
.It Cm rewind
Rewind the tape
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm offline , rewoffl
Rewind the tape and place the tape unit off-line (possibly eject)
(Count is ignored).
.It Cm blocksize
Sets the block size characteristics of the device to value specified in
.Ar count.
A 0 means variable sized blocks, and anything else means fixed block, 
with blocksize as that of
.Ar count.
.It Cm density
Set the density for the openned device  (bits 2,3 of minor number)
.Ar count
density code as specified by the SCSI II specification. Valid values
are from 0  to 0x17.
.It The different density codes are as follows:
0x0	default for device
.br
0xE	reserved for ECMA

.It Cm status
Print status information about the tape unit.
.El
.Pp
If a tape name is not specified, and the environment variable
.Ev TAPE
does not exist;
.Nm st
uses the device
.Pa /dev/rst0 .
.Pp
.Nm St
returns a 0 exit status when the operation(s) were successful,
1 if the command was unrecognized, and 2 if an operation failed.
.Sh ENVIRONMENT
If the following environment variable exists, it is utilized by
.Nm st .
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Ev TAPE
.Nm St
checks the
.Ev TAPE
environment variable if the
argument
.Ar tapename
is not given.
.Sh FILES

CAUTION!

This is a prototype version of the Linux Sound Driver for FreeBSD.

The official and supported version is 1.0c.

This version 'should work' but there may be some bugs and the programmers
API may change before the final version.

There are some additional programs for GUS owners in the 
gustest subdirectory of this directory, namely a module
(.MOD, .STM and .669) player and a patch file loader.
Additionally, there is a midithru program which allows
you to play the synth on the soundcard with a midi keyboard 
(also usable for OPL-3 owners).

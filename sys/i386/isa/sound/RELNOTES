Welcome to use the Linux sound driver for FreeBSD. This
driver supports the SoundBlaster, SB Pro, Pro Audio Spectrum 16,
AdLib and Gravis UltraSound sound cards.

In addition there is rather limited support for MPU-401
(and compatible) midi cards. Also, the OPL-3 synthesizer
of the SB Pro and PAS16 cards is now supported in the 4 OP
modes.

Most of the features of the /dev/sequencer device file are
available just for GUS owners. 

The SoundBlaster 16 and SB 16 ASP cards are not supported,
though they may work in mono mode with speeds < 22 kHz. 
The OPL-3 chicp of the SB 16 should work (without problems?).
Is there anybody willing to implement the SB 16 support 
(have the SB 16 and the SDK for it)?

Since this driver is a sound driver, it does not contain support
for SCSI/CD-ROM/Joystick -devices.

Known bugs
----------

- It's not possible to open /dev/dsp (or /dev/audio) while the 
  /dev/sequencer is open for output and GUS is the only soundcard
  installed. It's possible if /dev/dsp is opened before /dev/sequencer
  but at this time the GUS is not available for access via /dev/sequencer.
  This is a limitation of the driver.
- MPU-401 driver hangs the computer on boot if there is no MPU-401 installed.
  It uses by default the I/O port 0x330, which is also used by the
  Adaptec 1542 SCSI adapter.
- The /dev/sequencer playback to GUS sounds sometimes rather weird. Hitting
  ^C and playing again should solve this problem. This is probably caused by
  incompatibilities between the GUS and certain VLB motherboards. Try to avoid
  switching between VTs while patches are being loaded to the GUS.
- There is a skeleton of the patch manager support. It doesn't work in
  this version.

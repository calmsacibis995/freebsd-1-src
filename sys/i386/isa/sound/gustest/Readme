The programs in this directory are more or less incompletely implemented.
I have used them for debugging purposes while developing the driver.

Files in this directory:


../ultrasound.h	(sys/ultrasound.h)
		This file contains some macros which are similar than
		the procedures provided by GUSUNIT.PAS. See gustest.c
		for more information.
		INSTALL THIS FILE TO YOUR /usr/include/sys !!!!!!!!!!!!

gusload.c	This program can be used to load patches (samples) to
		the DRAM of GUS. It understands the format used in the
		.pat files shipped with GUS.

		Usage:	gusload pgm# patchfile.
		  or	gusload reset	#Removes all patches from memory.

		You should load just the patches you will need to play
		a Midi file, since the memory capacity of GUS is rather
		limited (256k-1M).

		Example:

			gusload 0 acpiano.pat
			gusload 1 britepno.pat
			gusload 19 church.pat

		This program is not required if the adagio package is
		used. It can do the patch uploading itself.

gmod.c		This is a simple module player which demonstrates 
		programming with GUS. It doesn't try to interpret
		most of the effect commands. In fact this program
		may interpret the modules incorrectly since I am
		not a module player expert.
		This version plays .MOD, .STM and .669 modules.

midithru.c	This program reads messages from the Midi interface
		and plays the notes with an internal synthesizer
		(FM or GUS). The program accepts one argument, the
		synthesizer device number. In addition to the note on
		and note off messages it interprets also program changes
		and channel pressure messages.
		If you need an example on programming the /dev/sequencer,
		this is a good one. The voice allocation algorithm is
		not good so don't look at it.

		NOTE!	This program is useful with gmod. Jus load
			a module with gmod. Wait until the module has
			finished or hit ^C. Now you can play the samples
			with the midithru program.

		NOTE2!	You need a Midi keyboard to use this program. In
			addition the Midi interface of GUS is not supported
			yet which means you need also PAS16 or MPU-401.

pmtest.c
gpatinfo.c	******* For information only ******* 
		These programs demonstrate the patch manager interface
		which will be included to some later driver version. 
		This interface is not complete in version 1.99.9.
		Using pmtest will hang your system sooner or later.
